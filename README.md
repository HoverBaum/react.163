Presenting how I structured my ReactJS based application.

Check it out at https://hoverbaum.github.io/react.163/#/

## Working on it

I use [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) to create this presentation. Here is how you might get to see it locally (requires [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HoverBaum/react.163.git reactPresentation
cd reactPresentation
npm install -g reveal-md
reveal-md --theme uzl ReactPresentation.md
```
