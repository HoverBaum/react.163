# ReactJS

### Structuring development

### ES6

The code in this presentation makes heavy use of [*ES6*](http://es6-features.org/). If you are not familiar with the syntax please look it up.

- [Arrow Functions](http://es6-features.org/#ExpressionBodies)
- [Constants](http://es6-features.org/#Constants)
- [Object.assign](http://es6-features.org/#ObjectPropertyAssignment)
- [Default values for parameters](http://es6-features.org/#DefaultParameterValues)
- [Exporting and importing](http://es6-features.org/#ValueExportImport)

Or read [a full introduction to ES6 features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features).

# An introduction

----

[*ReactJS*](https://facebook.github.io/react/) takes a simple enough approach:

> For a given state describe how to render your application.

Thus we need concepts and tools to compliment ReactJS when we want to build an application.

----

### Components

A *Component* is a description of how to render a part of our application, like a button.

```JavaScript
//A simple button component.
import React from 'react'

const button = ({disabled, text, click}) => (
    <button onClick={disabled ? () => {} : click} >
        {text}
    </button>
)

export default button
```

---

# Redux

> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

----

A popular approach to handle this `state` that ReactJS renders is [*Redux*](http://redux.js.org/).

It takes a unidirectional approach to dataflow. Meaning data only flows in a single direction. This makes our application more predictable.

### Store

The *Store* is the current representation of the state of your application.

```JavaScript
//The store is simply one big object in JavaScript.
{
    printing: false,
    orders: [...]
}
```

----

### Actions

You can think of this as an event. While the *Action* is the actual thing being propagated there are also *Actioncreators* which are functions used to create an action.

```JavaScript
//Use ES6 Syntax to define a function.
export const startPrinting = () => {
    return {
        type: 'PRINTING_START'
    }
}
```

----

### Reducers

*Reducers* are function that take a current store and return a new one based on an Action.

```JavaScript
//Return a state for the action or a standard one.
const printing = (state = false, action) => {
    if(action.type === 'PRINTING_START') {
        return true
    } else if(action.type === 'PRINTING_STOP') {
        return false
    } else {        
        return state
    }
}
```

# Testing

----

### Reducers

Since our reducers are pure functions they are an ideal thing to test.

[*Tape*](https://github.com/substack/tape) is a lightweight testing framework for JavaScript. Let's look at how to use it for our ReactJS application.

### Testfiles

└── test.js                     Entry point for all tests
```
